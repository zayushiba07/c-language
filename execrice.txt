Here are **5 practical exercises** based on the `else if` ladder concept, designed for beginner to intermediate learners. These will help practice conditional logic in C++, Java, Python, or any similar language.

### 🧠 **Exercise 1: Grade Calculator**

**Problem:**
Write a program that takes a percentage as input and prints the grade using the following conditions:

| Percentage | Grade |
| ---------- | ----- |
| 90–100     | A+    |
| 80–89      | A     |
| 70–79      | B     |
| 60–69      | C     |
| 50–59      | D     |
| below 50   | Fail  |

 Use `else if` ladder to implement this.

---

### **Exercise 2: Temperature Message**

**Problem:**
Input the current temperature and display a message:

* Above 40°C → “It’s too hot!”
* 30–40°C → “It’s warm.”
* 20–29°C → “Pleasant weather.”
* 10–19°C → “Cold weather.”
* Below 10°C → “Too cold!”

---

###  **Exercise 3: Number Classification**

**Problem:**
Input a number and classify it as:

* Positive Even
* Positive Odd
* Negative Even
* Negative Odd
* Zero

Use `else if` to determine the correct category.

------

###  **Exercise 5: Simple Calculator**

**Problem:**
Input two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and perform the correct operation.

Example input:
`Enter a = 10`
`Enter b = 5`
`Enter operator = /`
Output: `2.0`

###  **Exercise 6: Vowel or Consonant**

**Problem:**
Input a character and determine whether it is:

* A vowel (a, e, i, o, u)
* A consonant
* Not an alphabet

> Use `else if` ladder to check conditions.

---

###  **Exercise 7: Speed Fine Checker**

**Problem:**
Input a car's speed. Display fine category:

* Speed ≤ 60 → “No Fine”
* Speed 61–80 → “Warning”
* Speed 81–100 → “Fine ₹500”
* Speed > 100 → “License Suspended”

---

###  **Exercise 8: Blood Donation Eligibility**

**Problem:**
Input age and weight. Display:

* Age < 18 → “Not eligible (Too young)”
* Weight < 50 → “Not eligible (Underweight)”
* Else → “Eligible for blood donation”

---

###  **Exercise 9: BMI Category**

**Problem:**
Input a person's weight (kg) and height (m), calculate BMI:

```
BMI = weight / (height * height)
```

Display category:

* BMI < 18.5 → Underweight
* 18.5–24.9 → Normal
* 25–29.9 → Overweight
* 30 and above → Obese

---

###  **Exercise 10: Electricity Bill Calculator**

**Problem:**
Input total units consumed:

* ≤100 units → ₹2/unit
* 101–300 units → ₹3/unit
* 301–500 units → ₹5/unit
* > 500 units → ₹8/unit

Calculate and print total bill using `else if`.

---

###  **Exercise 11: Leap Year Checker**

**Problem:**
Input a year and display if it's:

###  **Exercise 16
A Rashi-related program is a program that takes the user's birth date (day and month) as input and determines their corresponding Rashi (Zodiac Sign) based on astrological date ranges.

The logic is typically implemented using an if-else if ladder, where each block checks if the given date falls within the specific date range of a Rashi.
